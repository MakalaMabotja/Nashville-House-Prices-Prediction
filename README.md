## Nashville Housing Data Analysis

### Overview:

This project analyzes Nashville housing data, encompassing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL data preparation, and machine learning for price prediction.

### Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and EDA:**
   - Loaded raw data ('NashvilleData.csv').
   - Dropped unnecessary columns.
   - Imputed missing values and engineered new features.
   - Explored data distribution and identified outliers.

2. **SQL Data Preparation:**
   - Extracted and transformed data using SQL queries.
   - Merged SQL data with Nashville dataset.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Utilized logarithmic transformation and one-hot encoding.
   - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

4. **Modeling:**
   - Trained various models (Decision Tree, XGBoost, Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, MLP, LSTM).
   - Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

### File Structure:

- `NashvilleData.csv`: Raw dataset.
- `NashvilleHousingCleaned.csv`: Cleaned dataset.
- `SQLExtractedData.csv`: Extracted data from SQL.
- `README.md`: Overview of steps and file structure.

### Libraries:

- **Data Cleaning and EDA:**
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

- **SQL Data Preparation:**
  - pandas, sqlite3

- **Modeling:**
  - scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, keras
